autoguess
=========
This is *chrome extension* that allowes *short text* to be completed *to* its *intended text*. 
For example during chatting we sometimes type `nyt` for `night` or `gn` for `good night` and most commonly `k` for `okay`. 
This sometimes create confusions and so this extension, which will enable chrome to automatically map these shortcuts to their respective texts. 
This extension works on any `textarea` element present in the `DOM`. So, this will not only complete 
words for you but also increase you typing speed. 
Happy typing ;)
